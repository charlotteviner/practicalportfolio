## Core Skills Practical Portfolio: Agent-Based Model

During the practicals on this module, I created an agent-based model that:
* builds agents in space;
* gets them to interact with each other;
* reads in environmental data;
* gets the agents to interact with the environment
* randomises the order of agents interactions;
* displays the model as an animation;
* is contained within a GUI, and;
* is initialised with data from the web.

I also made some additions to the model, including creating a parameter sweeper which allows multiple sets of parameters to be run into the model.
